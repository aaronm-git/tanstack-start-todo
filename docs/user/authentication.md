# Authentication (Clerk)

This app uses Clerk to sign users in and out.

## What you can do

- Sign in and access authenticated parts of the app.
- Sign out to end your session.

## Setup (local development)

Ask a developer for the Clerk publishable key and set it in your `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
```
