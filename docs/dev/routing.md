# Routing (file-based)

This project uses TanStack Router with file-based routing.

## Adding a route

Add a new file in `src/routes/`. TanStack generates the route configuration from files.

## Where to look in the code

- Route files live in `src/routes/`.
- The generated route tree lives in `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
- The router is created in `src/router.tsx`.
